> Sulla is a javascript library which provides a high-level API control to Whatsapp so it can be configured to automatize resposes or any data that goes trough Whatsapp effortlessly.
>
> It is built using [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) and based on [this python wrapper](https://github.com/mukulhase/WebWhatsapp-Wrapper)
>
> By deafult sulla will try to use Google Chrome driver if installed, if not, it will use integrated Chromium instance

  client.onMessage((message) => {

##### After executing `create()` function, **sulla** will create an instance of whatsapp web. If you are not logged in, it will print a QR code in the terminal. Scan it with your phone and you are ready to go!

##### Sulla will remember the session so there is no need to authenticate everytime.

##### Multiples sessions can be created at the same time by pasing a session name to `create()` function:

```javascript
// Init sales whatsapp bot
sulla.create('sales').then((salesBot) => {...});

// Init support whatsapp bot
sulla.create('support').then((supportBot) => {...});
```
